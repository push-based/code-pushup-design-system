# Theme Coverage Plugin

The goal of this plugin is to maintain the quality of design system components.

The major part of CSS tokens is automatically generated by the FigmaExporter. If variables change in Figma, the exporter will generate new tokens. 
The plugin checks if the generated tokens are used in the design system components. Any old token that is still used in the sourcecode will be marked as deprecated.

The plugin also checks if the generated mixins are used in the design system components. Any old mixin that is still used in the sourcecode will be marked as deprecated.

Typically, the plugin is configured to checks the `design-system/generated` folder for deprecated tokens and mixins.

## Deprecated Token Usage Audit - `deprecated-token-<token-name>`
