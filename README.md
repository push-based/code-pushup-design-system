## Reporting Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools to help with reporting and analytics of the current development efforts.
The goal is to give **an exact volume of the number of code changes needed to reach a desired goal**.

The tools are documented here:

- [Design System Status Tracking](./plugins/README.md)

Todos:

- autogenerate cd components config
  - manual handling of classes
- autoconfig config files `code-push.config.ts`
- fix `nx-plugin`
- usage stats - count of how often used
- merge helper
- bench test asset resolving
-
